# Exercise 8 - Investment Fund

This is the final exercise whose results will be presented in the lecture.

## Task

Implement an [InvestmentFund](../src/com/agentecon/exercise9/InvestmentFund.java) that competes with the funds of the other teams. Note that there might be adjustments to how the ranking is made in order to prevent unreasonable results. Also, the length of the simulation (currently 10'000 days) should not be taken for granted. 

## Deliverables and deadline

In the presentation, you should not only show what your fund finally looked like, but also how you got there and the economic reasoning behind it. Feel free to still use a [lab journal](exercise09-journal.md) internally to coordinate yourself and to keep track of what you tried out.

The deadline for submitting the presentation slides (in pdf format) and the source code is 14:00 of the day your group is scheduled to hold it.
